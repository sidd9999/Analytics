# Analytics
Stock analysis and strategy testing for TSLA as in RSI 14. In RStudio, created a code to analyse and screen the required stock, here TSLA, using the quantmod package and its functions.
Charting and vector can be analysed by providing a time frame.
Then a code is written to add a technical indicator, here RSI (14) to devise a buy/sell strategy.
Now another package called "PerformanceAnalytics" is used to chart and quantify its success over a period of time.
The final code is in the file scr.R
